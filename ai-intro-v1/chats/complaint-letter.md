Draft a complaint letter for me regarding a recent hotel stay.  The issues were:
- Unclean condition on arrival.
- Unhelpful/rude staff.
- Excessive noise from the room above after 10:00pm, and again, an unhelpful response from staff when alerted to the situation.

The letter should be strongly worded and demand a full refund.

Here's a draft of your complaint letter:

**Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Unacceptable Stay ‚Äì Request for Full Refund**  

Dear [Hotel Manager‚Äôs Name],  

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding my recent stay at [Hotel Name] on [Check-in Date] in Room [Room Number]. The experience was entirely unacceptable, and I am requesting a full refund due to the numerous issues I encountered.  

First and foremost, upon arrival, the room was in an unclean condition. This is completely unacceptable, as cleanliness is a basic expectation of any hotel stay. The lack of attention to hygiene created an uncomfortable and unwelcoming environment.  

Furthermore, when I raised concerns with the front desk, I was met with unhelpful and rude staff. Rather than addressing the issue professionally, their dismissive attitude only compounded my frustration. This level of customer service is appalling and falls far below the standards any guest should expect.  

To make matters worse, excessive noise from the room above disrupted my stay well past 10:00 PM. Despite contacting the front desk to report the issue, I was again met with an unhelpful response, and no action was taken to resolve the disturbance. The lack of enforcement of basic quiet hours reflects extremely poor management and consideration for guest comfort.  

Given the unsanitary conditions, the unprofessional behavior of your staff, and the complete disregard for guest experience, I find it entirely reasonable to demand a full refund for my stay. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint, including leaving a public review detailing my experience and pursuing further action through consumer protection agencies.  

I expect a response confirming my full refund within [reasonable timeframe, e.g., five business days]. You may contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email] should you require any additional information.  

I trust you will take this matter seriously and address these serious deficiencies in your establishment‚Äôs service and management.  

Sincerely,  

**[Your Name]**

This version keeps the tone professional yet firm, making it clear that a refund is expected while also implying potential escalation if the issue is not resolved. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to adjust the wording further!

Generate another version with a lighter touch, maybe even insert a little humor.

Sure! Here‚Äôs a version with a lighter tone and a touch of humor while still making it clear that you expect a refund:

**Subject: A Less-Than-Restful Stay ‚Äì Request for Refund**  

Dear [Hotel Manager‚Äôs Name],  

I recently had the pleasure‚Äîor rather, the misfortune‚Äîof staying at [Hotel Name] on [Check-in Date] in Room [Room Number]. While I had been looking forward to a relaxing and enjoyable stay, what I actually got was something closer to a survival challenge.  

Let‚Äôs start with the room. When I walked in, I had to double-check that I hadn‚Äôt accidentally wandered into the staff‚Äôs ‚Äúbefore‚Äù picture for a deep-cleaning ad. It was not in the condition one would expect when checking into a reputable hotel. I don‚Äôt mind a little adventure now and then, but I prefer my lodging to be free of mystery stains.  

Then there was the staff. When I sought assistance, I was met with a level of unhelpfulness that could best be described as ‚Äúcustomer service in reverse.‚Äù Not only did my concerns go unaddressed, but I also got the distinct impression that I was inconveniencing them by expecting, well‚Ä¶ service.  

And the noise‚Äîoh, the noise. I assumed your hotel had a quiet hours policy, but based on the party happening in the room above mine well past 10:00 PM, I can only guess it was either optional or purely aspirational. When I called the front desk for help, the response I received was as effective as a ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù approach to noise control.  

Given these issues‚Äîunclean conditions, indifferent staff, and a noise level rivaling a rock concert‚ÄîI believe a full refund is not only reasonable but the absolute least that could be done to make amends. I would appreciate confirmation of this refund within [reasonable timeframe, e.g., five business days]. If you need to reach me, I‚Äôm available at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email].  

I sincerely hope my experience was an unfortunate fluke rather than the norm. I look forward to your response and, ideally, a resolution that doesn‚Äôt require me to warn future travelers via online reviews.  

Best,  
**[Your Name]**

This keeps things light but still makes it clear that you were dissatisfied and expect a refund. Let me know if you'd like any tweaks!

For the fun of it, give me a Rodney Dangerfield version too.

Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a version in the style of Rodney Dangerfield‚Äîfull of self-deprecating humor and zingers while still making it clear you want a refund.

**Subject: No Respect! A Complaint About My Stay**  

Dear [Hotel Manager‚Äôs Name],  

Let me tell ya, I travel a lot, but my stay at [Hotel Name]‚Äîoh boy, it was rough. I mean, I‚Äôve had bad hotel experiences before, but this one? This one deserves an award. You know it‚Äôs bad when you check into a room and the cockroaches leave a bad review on *you*!  

First, the room. I walked in and thought, ‚ÄúDid I get the wrong place, or did the last guest forget to check out‚Ä¶ two months ago?‚Äù The place was so dirty, even the dust bunnies were coughing! I‚Äôve seen cleaner bus stations, and that‚Äôs saying something.  

Then there was the staff. I asked for a little help, and I swear, I‚Äôve gotten more warmth from my in-laws. I said, ‚ÄúExcuse me, my room‚Äôs not clean.‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúWell, neither is our pay, so what do you want?‚Äù I tell ya, no respect!  

And the noise‚Äîwho knew I booked a room directly under *WrestleMania*? After 10:00 PM, it sounded like they were bowling up there‚Äîwith the furniture! I called the front desk, and their response? ‚ÄúOh yeah, that happens sometimes.‚Äù Happens *sometimes*?! What is this, a training camp for tap dancers?  

Listen, I didn‚Äôt book this stay to experience the full spectrum of disappointment. I came for a comfortable night, not a stress test. Given the unclean room, the rude staff, and the noise level of a construction site, I think a full refund is more than fair‚Äîconsider it hazard pay for surviving the experience.  

I‚Äôd appreciate a response confirming my refund within [reasonable timeframe, e.g., five business days]. You can reach me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email]. If you need me, I‚Äôll be at home, trying to catch up on the sleep I lost at your hotel!  

Sincerely,  
**[Your Name]**
