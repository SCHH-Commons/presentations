Chernobyl sarcophagus 

===

The **Chernobyl Sarcophagus** was the original containment structure built over Reactor 4 of the **Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant** after the catastrophic explosion and meltdown on **April 26, 1986**. It was an emergency response to prevent further radioactive contamination from escaping into the environment.

### **Original Sarcophagus (1986)**
- Constructed hurriedly between **May and November 1986** by Soviet engineers.
- Made of over **400,000 cubic meters of concrete and 7,300 tons of metal**.
- Designed to **trap radioactive materials** inside the destroyed reactor.
- Had **numerous structural weaknesses**, including gaps and an unstable foundation.
- Deteriorated over time due to **exposure to radiation, weather, and structural flaws**.

### **New Safe Confinement (NSC) (2016)**
Due to the deterioration of the original sarcophagus, a more advanced containment structure was built:
- **New Safe Confinement (NSC)**, a massive **steel arch**, was **slid into place in 2016**.
- It is **the largest movable land-based structure** ever built (165 meters wide, 110 meters tall, 257 meters long).
- Designed to **last at least 100 years** and enable safe dismantling of the reactor remains.
- Equipped with **ventilation, monitoring, and robotic systems** for ongoing decommissioning.

The NSC now covers the original sarcophagus, ensuring that radioactive materials remain contained while allowing future work to safely dismantle Reactor 4.
