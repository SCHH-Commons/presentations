Evaluate this floor plan and suggest ways in which storage space could be expanded.

===

This floor plan is well-organized with a good flow between spaces, but storage could be expanded in a few ways:

### **1. Expand Laundry Room Storage**
- The laundry room (LAUN) already has an optional washer/dryer (OPT. W/D), but additional storage can be added by:
  - Installing overhead cabinets above the washer and dryer.
  - Adding a tall storage cabinet for cleaning supplies and linens.

### **2. Utilize Garage Space More Efficiently**
- The **2-car garage** is spacious (20'0" x 20'9"), and storage could be enhanced by:
  - Installing ceiling-mounted racks for seasonal storage.
  - Adding built-in shelving along the walls for tools and supplies.
  - Using the optional attic storage more effectively with pull-down stairs for easy access.

### **3. Optimize the Walk-In Closet (WIC)**
- The owner's suite **walk-in closet (WIC)** could be improved by:
  - Installing floor-to-ceiling shelves on one wall.
  - Incorporating built-in drawers to reduce reliance on bedroom furniture.
  - Using double hanging rods to maximize hanging space.

### **4. Increase Kitchen Storage**
- The **kitchen** could benefit from:
  - Additional upper cabinets above the refrigerator (if not already included).
  - Pull-out pantry shelves for better accessibility.
  - A small built-in pantry in the **café** area (if wall space allows).

### **5. Use the Flex Room for Storage**
- The **Flex Room** (9'1" x 9'9") could double as a storage space with:
  - Built-in shelves or cabinets along one wall.
  - A murphy bed with storage compartments if used as a guest space.

### **6. Utilize the Covered Patio for Outdoor Storage**
- The **covered patio** could be enhanced with:
  - A storage bench for outdoor cushions or garden tools.
  - Wall-mounted racks for frequently used outdoor items.

### **9. Install a Sliding Barn Door (If Space Allows)**

I think it might be possible to gut the pantry and install an IKEA-based storage system.  What do you think?

===

That’s a great idea! IKEA storage systems are **modular, affordable, and highly customizable**, making them a solid option for optimizing your pantry space. If you’re open to gutting the existing pantry and replacing it with an **IKEA-based storage solution**, here’s how you could approach it:

---

### **1. Choose the Right IKEA System**
IKEA offers several **kitchen organization systems** that could work well for a pantry redesign:
- **BOAXEL**: A wall-mounted, modular shelving system that allows for adjustable shelves, baskets, and pull-out storage.
- **SEKTION Cabinet System**: If you prefer enclosed pantry cabinets with pull-out shelves and doors.
- **PLATSA**: A flexible, stackable storage system that can be built out for pantry needs.
- **PAX Wardrobe System (Hacked for Pantry Use!)**: A customizable option with pull-out drawers and shelving that could work well for dry storage.

---

### **2. Design Your Ideal Layout**
Depending on your space, you might consider:
- **Tall pantry cabinets** with **pull-out drawers** to maximize deep storage.
- **Wall-mounted open shelving** to keep everyday items visible and accessible.
- **Sliding wire baskets** for produce or snack storage.
- **Vertical dividers** for baking trays, cutting boards, and other flat items.
- **A combination of closed cabinets and open shelves** to balance accessibility and aesthetics.

---

### **3. IKEA Storage Add-Ons for Maximum Efficiency**
- **VARIERA** pull-out bins & drawer organizers: Great for keeping spices, packets, and dry goods organized.
- **UTRUSTA pull-out shelves**: If you want deeper cabinets but need easy access.
- **GRUNDTAL rails & hooks**: Perfect for hanging kitchen tools, towels, or baskets.
- **OMAR shelving**: A simple, sturdy metal shelving unit that works well for pantry storage.
- **RASKOG rolling cart**: If you want a mobile pantry section for frequently used items.

---

### **4. Installation Considerations**
- **Measure carefully!** IKEA units come in standard sizes, so ensuring the right fit is key.
- **Check wall support.** If removing drywall, you might need to reinforce for wall-mounted systems like BOAXEL.
- **Consider lighting.** IKEA sells LED strip lighting that can improve visibility in the pantry.

---

### **5. Potential Challenges & Workarounds**
- **Limited width/depth?** Consider SEKTION wall cabinets for a shallower footprint.
- **Odd wall spaces?** Use a mix of open shelving and pull-out drawers to adapt.
- **Too much open storage?** Combine IKEA’s glass-door cabinets to keep things neat.

### **Final Thoughts**
A **custom IKEA-based pantry system** can:
✔️ **Increase storage capacity**  
✔️ **Make organization easier**  
✔️ **Improve accessibility with pull-out drawers**  
✔️ **Look clean & modern**
