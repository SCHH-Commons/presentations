What is the healthiest option for an entree?

===

The healthiest entr√©e option on this menu appears to be the **Heart Healthy Rice Bowl (13.49)**. It includes:
- **Whole grains**: Warm brown rice, which provides fiber and nutrients.
- **Vegetables**: Broccoli and white bean ragu, wilted spinach.
- **Healthy fats**: Lemon basil vinaigrette.
- **Lean protein options**: You can add chicken (+5.95), grilled shrimp (+6.95), or grilled salmon (+7.49), with salmon being the best choice due to its omega-3 fatty acids.

This dish offers a balanced mix of fiber, protein, and healthy fats while avoiding fried or heavily processed ingredients.

Any good choices for an appetizer?

===

For a healthier appetizer choice, consider the Classic Hummus (9.95):

It comes with sliced cucumber and toasted pita, providing a good balance of fiber and whole grains.
Hummus is made from chickpeas, which are rich in plant-based protein, fiber, and healthy fats.
Compared to other appetizers, it avoids fried foods and heavy cheeses, making it a lighter and more nutritious option.
If you want something warm, the Vegetable Egg Rolls (8.49) might also be a decent option, as they contain vegetables and are served with a sweet-spicy Thai chili dipping sauce. However, they may be fried, so the hummus is the better choice for a truly healthy option.
