**Non-Venomous Snakes:**

The majority of snakes in the area are non-venomous and play a crucial role in controlling pest populations. Common non-venomous species include:

- **Southern Black Racer**: A slender, fast-moving snake with a jet-black back and a gray belly. They are active during the day and help control rodent populations.

- **Rough Green Snake**: A slender, bright green snake that primarily feeds on insects and spiders.

- **Corn Snake**: Recognizable by their orange or brownish-yellow coloring with black-bordered red blotches, they are often found in wooded areas.

- **Eastern Garter Snake**: Typically dark with three light stripes running lengthwise, they are commonly found near water sources.

**Venomous Snakes:**

While less common, several venomous snakes inhabit the region. It's important to recognize and maintain a safe distance from them:

- **Southern Copperhead**: Identified by their distinctive hourglass-shaped crossbands, they are often found in wooded or rocky areas. 

- **Eastern Cottonmouth (Water Moccasin)**: A stout, dark-colored snake often found near water, known for the white lining inside its mouth. 

- **Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake**: The largest venomous snake in North America, identifiable by the diamond pattern along its back. 

- **Canebrake (Timber) Rattlesnake**: Typically found in forested areas, they have a distinct rattle and a pattern of dark bands.

**Safety Tips:**

- **Avoidance**: If you encounter a snake, do not attempt to handle or provoke it. Most snakes will retreat if left undisturbed.

- **Awareness**: Be cautious when walking in natural areas, especially near water or tall grass.

- **Pet Safety**: Keep pets on a leash and prevent them from investigating underbrush or holes where snakes may reside.
