Explain TIPS and TIPS Ladders as an income strategy.

### **TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) and TIPS Ladders as an Income Strategy**

#### **What Are TIPS?**
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are U.S. government bonds designed to protect against inflation. Their principal value adjusts based on changes in the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, ensuring that both the value of your investment and the interest payments keep pace with inflation. 

- **Interest Payments:** Paid semiannually at a fixed rate, but since they are based on the adjusted principal, the dollar amount of the interest increases with inflation.
- **Maturity Options:** Typically available in **5-, 10-, and 30-year terms**.
- **Inflation Protection:** If inflation rises, the principal of the TIPS increases. At maturity, investors receive either the adjusted principal or the original amount, whichever is higher.

TIPS provide **real (inflation-adjusted) income**, making them attractive for retirees or those looking for predictable purchasing power over time.

### **TIPS Ladders as an Income Strategy**
A **TIPS ladder** is a strategy where an investor buys TIPS with staggered maturities so that a portion of the investment matures each year, providing a steady stream of inflation-protected income.

#### **How It Works**
1. **Purchase TIPS with Different Maturities**  
   - Example: Buy TIPS that mature in **1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years**.  
   - Each year, one set of TIPS matures, and the principal can be reinvested in a new 5-year TIPS.

2. **Benefit from Inflation Protection**  
   - The interest payments adjust with inflation, ensuring the income maintains its purchasing power.
   - The ladder structure provides liquidity by having a portion of the bonds mature regularly.

3. **Reinvesting Maturing TIPS**  
   - If you don’t need the principal, you can reinvest in newly issued TIPS to maintain the ladder.

### **Advantages of a TIPS Ladder**
✅ **Steady, Inflation-Protected Income** – Unlike traditional bonds, the payments and final principal increase with inflation.  
✅ **Low Credit Risk** – Backed by the U.S. government, making them one of the safest investments.  
✅ **Predictable Cash Flow** – Maturing bonds provide liquidity at regular intervals.  
✅ **Tax Advantages in Tax-Advantaged Accounts** – Best held in **IRAs or other tax-sheltered accounts**, as TIPS principal adjustments are taxed as income even though they are not paid out until maturity.
