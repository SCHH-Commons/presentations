# The Dream of Thinking Machines  
## 1950s–1970s
]

![](images/Dream_of_Thinking_Machines.png)

.content.double-space[
- AI Research began
- Enthusiasm about human-like intelligence  
- Early computers tackled simple, rule-base tasks  
]

???

## 3. The Dream of Thinking Machines  
### 1950s–1970s

- In the 1950s, researchers began dreaming of machines that could think like humans. The term *Artificial Intelligence* was coined in 1956 at a Dartmouth workshop attended by pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy.
- The early belief was that if we could model human logic, we could teach it to computers — like a recipe for thought.
- But human intelligence turned out to be more complicated than expected. Understanding context, emotion, or even language was far beyond the computers of the time.
- Still, this was the start — the moment the seed of AI was planted.

- Progress was slow
- Computers weren't powerful enough, and AI promises fell flat.

]

## 4. The AI Winter  
### 1970s–1980s

- Optimism faded as it became clear that early AI systems couldn't live up to the hype — they struggled with anything outside of narrow, rule-based tasks.
- Computers weren’t powerful enough, and the "intelligent" programs of the time were brittle and limited.
- Funding dried up, enthusiasm waned, and AI entered a long quiet period — later called the *AI Winter*.
- But in the background, some researchers kept going. They explored new ideas that would quietly set the stage for the breakthroughs to come.

## 5. When Machines Surprised Us  
### 1997

- In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. It was the first time a computer had beaten a human grandmaster in a match under standard tournament rules.
- Kasparov had beaten Deep Blue a year earlier — and accused IBM of foul play after the loss. It was a powerful moment that made the world sit up and pay attention.
- Deep Blue wasn’t "thinking" like a person — it used brute-force search and evaluated over 200 million positions per second.
- Still, it marked the first real shift in public awareness: machines could now do more than crunch numbers — they could compete in areas once thought uniquely human.

## 6. Watson on Jeopardy!  
### 2011

- In 2011, IBM returned with another AI challenger — Watson — which played and won *Jeopardy!* against the two greatest champions of the game.
- Watson wasn’t just searching for facts. It had to interpret wordplay, puns, and obscure clues — and then buzz in faster than the humans.
- It had no internet access — just a massive internal knowledge base and algorithms to parse questions, score possible answers, and respond in natural language.
- It marked a turning point: AI was back in the spotlight, and now it could *understand* us — or at least fake it convincingly.

## 7. The Rise of Deep Learning  
### 2012–2020

- Around 2012, AI took off again — this time powered by *deep learning*, a new way of training machines using huge amounts of data and layered neural networks.
- Deep learning allowed AI to do things we once thought were out of reach — like recognizing faces, understanding speech, and translating languages.
- Voice assistants, smart cameras, and recommendation engines became part of everyday life — and most people didn’t even realize AI was behind it.
- The key difference? These systems weren’t programmed with rules — they *learned* by example, often from millions or billions of data points.

- In late 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT — and for many people, it felt like AI had suddenly leapt forward overnight.
- Within weeks, millions of people were having natural conversations with AI — asking questions, writing stories, solving problems.
- It wasn’t the first language model, but it was the first that felt accessible, coherent, and helpful in a wide range of situations.
- For many, it was a "Sputnik moment" — a sudden realization that the world had changed, and we were entering a new era.

## 9. What Is Generative AI?  
### And Why It Feels Different

- Most earlier AI systems just *classified* things — is this a cat or a dog? Is this email spam?
- Generative AI creates things: stories, code, images, songs — all based on patterns it’s learned from vast datasets.
- It doesn’t just retrieve information — it can compose new content that feels coherent and creative.
- This shift from *recognizing* to *generating* is one of the biggest leaps we’ve seen in

]

???

## 10. The Power Behind the Magic: Large Language Models (LLMs)
### The Engines Behind Chatbots

- ChatGPT is powered by a Large Language Model — trained on books, articles, websites, and other text sources.
- It doesn’t “know” facts in the way we do — it predicts likely words based on patterns in language.
- These models can answer questions, summarize content, translate, and mimic many styles of writing.
- But they don’t understand like humans — they’re guessing really, really well at what should come next.

## 16. Is It Always Right?  
### Not Quite.

- AI can sound confident — even when it’s completely wrong. These mistakes are called *hallucinations*.
- It might make up facts, misquote sources, or invent people, products, and dates.
- The internet is full of bias and misinformation — and AI can sometimes reflect that too.
- That’s why it’s important to double-check anything serious. Think of AI as an assistant, not an authority.

- AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, refers to AI that can match or exceed human ability across most tasks.
- Today’s AI is powerful — but still narrow. AGI would be broad, flexible, and adaptive.
- Some experts think AGI could arrive within a decade. Others say it’s still far off.
- And beyond that? ASI — Artificial Super Intelligence — could change everything. But for now, we’re still learning to walk.
