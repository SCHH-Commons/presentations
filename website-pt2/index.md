## How Our Site Works

1. **Write content in Markdown**  
   - Instead of using complicated code, we write text with simple formatting (like `#` for headings or `**bold**` for bold text).  

2. **GitHub stores the website files**  
   - These files are saved in a special online folder (a GitHub repository).  

3. **Jekyll converts Markdown into a website**  
   - It automatically turns Markdown text into web pages with a clean layout.  

4. **GitHub Pages publishes the website**  
   - The website is made live on the internet using a free web address (e.g., `yourname.github.io`).  

Once set up, updating the website is as easy as **editing a text file**‚Äîno need to touch complicated code!

## Blog-Style Websites  

A **blog-style website** organizes content into a series of posts, usually displayed **newest first**. It‚Äôs great for:  
- Sharing updates, articles, or journal entries.  
- Organizing content into categories or tags.  
- Automatically generating a homepage that lists recent posts.  

### Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a **popular website generator** that turns plain text files (Markdown) into a full website. It‚Äôs popular for blogs because:  
- It **automates** the creation of blog posts and pages.  
- It uses **templates**, so posts look consistent.  
- It works with **GitHub Pages**, making publishing easy. 
- It has a large ecosystem of developers and tools

For this website starter I've stripped Jekyll's default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme down to its essential elements providing an out-of-the-box configuration that is easy to setup and maintain while still providing many useful features.

## GitHub 

GitHub is a **free online service** for storing and managing files, especially for websites and projects.  

### **Why Use GitHub?**  
‚úÖ **Stores your website files safely online**  
‚úÖ **Tracks changes** so you can go back to previous versions  
‚úÖ **Allows collaboration** ‚Äì multiple people can work on the same project  
‚úÖ **Works with GitHub Pages** to **host your website for free**  

Think of GitHub as a **file cabinet** for your website, where everything is organized and versioned.

## GitHub Repositories  

A **repository (repo)** is like a folder that stores all the files for a project.  

### **In a GitHub Repository, You Can:**  
üìÇ Store files ‚Äì like your website content and settings  
üìú Edit and update files ‚Äì change text, images, or settings  
üåê Publish your site ‚Äì GitHub Pages makes it live on the web  
üîÑ Track changes ‚Äì see what‚Äôs been updated over time  

Each website we create will have **its own repository** on GitHub.

## Creating a Website  

To quickly set up your own blog-style website, we will clone an existing site.  The website we'll be cloning is a Jekyll template that only requires minor updates for a working website.

üîπ Cloning creates **your own copy** of an existing GitHub repository.  
üîπ This lets you customize the site without affecting the original.  
üîπ It‚Äôs an easy way to get started with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  

### **What‚Äôs in the Starter Website?**  

‚úÖ A simple Jekyll blog with example posts  
‚úÖ A basic layout, already set up for you.  
‚úÖ Configurable settings for personalization.

## Website Creation - Step by Step

   - Go to the GitHub repository page of the Website Template.
       - https://github.com/SCHH-Commons/website-template
   - Click the green **Use this template** button located in the top-right section of the page and then select the **Create a new repository** option.
   - This creates a copy in **your own GitHub account**.  
1. **Modify the `_config.yml` File**  
   - Update site title, description, and other settings.  
1. **Customize Your Content**  
   - Edit or delete the example blog posts.  
   - Add new Markdown files for your own posts.  
1. **Publish Your Site**  
   - GitHub Pages will automatically generate your website.  
   - View it at `yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.  

After this process, you‚Äôll have **your own personalized website** up and running!
