## How a Website Works â€“ A High-Level Overview

A **web page** is built using three main technologies:  
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** â€“ Provides the structure and content of the page (text, images, links, etc.).  
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** â€“ Controls the appearance of the page (colors, fonts, layout).  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Adds interactivity and dynamic elements (such as buttons that respond when clicked).  

A **web page** is displayed in a **web browser** (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) on a **user's device** (laptop, smartphone, tablet).  

Web pages are stored on **servers** (computers connected to the internet). When a user types a **web address (URL)** or clicks a link, their browser sends a request to the server. The server responds by sending back the web page, which the browser then displays.  

A **website** is a collection of one or more web pages, usually linked together so users can navigate between them.

## Building a Website with GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Markdown

Instead of writing complex code, we can use **simpler tools** to create and manage a website:  
- **Markdown** â€“ A simple way to write content using easy-to-read text formatting.  
- **Jekyll** â€“ A tool that turns Markdown files into a website.  
- **GitHub Pages** â€“ A free hosting service that automatically publishes the website online.  

This approach lets us build a professional-looking website **without needing to code in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript**.  

---

## How It Works â€“ Step by Step

1. **Write content in Markdown**  
   - Instead of using complicated code, we write text with simple formatting (like `#` for headings or `**bold**` for bold text).  

2. **GitHub stores the website files**  
   - These files are saved in a special online folder (a GitHub repository).  

3. **Jekyll converts Markdown into a website**  
   - It automatically turns Markdown text into web pages with a clean layout.  

4. **GitHub Pages publishes the website**  
   - The website is made live on the internet using a free web address (e.g., `yourname.github.io`).  

Once set up, updating the website is as easy as **editing a text file**â€”no need to touch complicated code!

## What is a Blog-Style Website?  

A **blog-style website** organizes content into a series of posts, usually displayed **newest first**. Itâ€™s great for:  
- Sharing updates, articles, or journal entries.  
- Organizing content into categories or tags.  
- Automatically generating a homepage that lists recent posts.  

### Why Use Jekyll?  
Jekyll is a **simple website generator** that turns plain text files (Markdown) into a full website. Itâ€™s popular for blogs because:  
- It **automates** the creation of blog posts and pages.  
- It uses **templates**, so posts look consistent.  
- It works with **GitHub Pages**, making publishing easy.  

---

## How a Jekyll Blog Works  

1. **Write blog posts in Markdown**  
   - Each post is a simple text file, stored in the `_posts` folder.  
1. **Jekyll formats the posts automatically**  
   - It applies a template to make posts look professional.  
1. **The homepage updates itself**  
   - New posts appear at the top without extra work.  
1. **GitHub Pages hosts the site for free**  
   - Once published, your blog is live on the web.  

### Why Use This Approach?  
âœ… No coding required â€“ just write text files.  
âœ… Fast, secure, and free hosting with GitHub Pages.  
âœ… Updating the site is as easy as adding a new text file!  

By the end of this class, you'll have your own **simple blog-style website** using Jekyll!

## The Versatility of a Blog-Style Website  

A **blog-style website** isnâ€™t just for personal blogsâ€”itâ€™s a flexible format that can be used for many different types of websites.  

### **Examples of How It Can Be Used**  
ðŸ”¹ **Personal Blog** â€“ Share thoughts, stories, or daily experiences.  
ðŸ”¹ **Project Updates** â€“ Document progress on a hobby, research, or work project.  
ðŸ”¹ **Event Announcements** â€“ Post news, schedules, or recaps for a club or community.  
ðŸ”¹ **Learning Journal** â€“ Keep track of new skills, tutorials, or study notes.  
ðŸ”¹ **Documentation & Guides** â€“ Provide instructions, FAQs, or technical documentation.  
ðŸ”¹ **Portfolio** â€“ Showcase writing, photography, or other creative work.  

---

## Why a Blog-Style Website Works Well  

âœ… **Easy to Update** â€“ Just add a new post, and the site updates itself.  
âœ… **Organized & Searchable** â€“ Posts are automatically sorted by date and can be categorized.  
âœ… **Customizable** â€“ Jekyll supports themes and layouts, making it adaptable for different styles.  
âœ… **No Need for Databases** â€“ Unlike WordPress, Jekyll sites are fast and secure because they donâ€™t rely on a backend database.  
âœ… **Great for Static Content** â€“ Perfect for any site where content doesnâ€™t need to change in real-time.  

By structuring your site in a blog-style format, you get a **simple, low-maintenance, and flexible** way to present content for almost any purpose! ðŸš€

## Getting Started: Forking a Website  

To quickly set up your own blog-style website, we will **fork** an existing site.  

### **What Does Forking Mean?**  
ðŸ”¹ Forking creates **your own copy** of an existing GitHub repository.  
ðŸ”¹ This lets you customize the site without affecting the original.  
ðŸ”¹ Itâ€™s an easy way to get started with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  

### **Whatâ€™s in the Starter Website?**  
âœ… A simple Jekyll blog with example posts about **<a href="https://schh-commons.github.io/schh-day-trips" target="_blank">Day Trips from SCHH</a>**  
âœ… A basic layout, already set up for you.  
âœ… Configurable settings for personalization.
